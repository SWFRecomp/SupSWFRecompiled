# SWFRecomp

This is a stupid idea.

# Let's do it anyway.

SWFRecomp is largely inspired by Wiseguy's [N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp), a static recompiler (not emulator) for N64 games that translates N64 MIPS instructions into C code that can be compiled into a native port. You should probably check that out, because it's epic. So is he. :D

This project aims to do the same thing, except with SWF files, i.e. Adobe Flash applications.

## So is this like, illegal or whatever?

Fortunately, no. As part of the [Open Screen Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20080506095459/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200804/050108AdobeOSP.html), Adobe removed many restrictions from their SWF format, including restrictions on creating software that _plays and renders SWF files_.

They even went as far as to [donate the Flex 3 SDK to Apache](https://www.pcworld.com/article/478324/adobe_donates_flex_to_apache-2.html) back in 2011, in favor of the wild uprising of HTML5. Apache Flex is now licensed under the, well, Apache License (a permissive open-source license).

## So what can this do right now?

Currently it successfully decompresses "C" SWFs and reads the data from the header.
