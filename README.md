# SupSWFRecompiled

So was this not a stupid idea either?

# ...no this one was pretty dumb.

This project steals a lot of the CMakeLists.txt file from [Zelda64Recomp](https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp), a project recompiled with Wiseguy's [N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp).

This testbench brings everything full circle. It makes use of both SWFRecomp repos to build a native pc port of a simple SWF.

## So is this like, illegal or whatever?

Fortunately, no. As part of the [Open Screen Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20080506095459/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200804/050108AdobeOSP.html), Adobe removed many restrictions from their SWF format, including restrictions on creating software that _plays and renders SWF files_.

They even went as far as to [donate the Flex 3 SDK to Apache](https://www.pcworld.com/article/478324/adobe_donates_flex_to_apache-2.html) back in 2011, in favor of the wild uprising of HTML5. Apache Flex is now licensed under the, well, Apache License (a permissive open-source license).

## So what can this do right now?

This runs a call to `trace` from SWF version 4, using the original DoAction system (not ActionScript 3).
